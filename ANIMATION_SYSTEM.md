# Physics-Based Animation System Documentation

## Overview

The TikTok Battle Arena now features a **physics-driven ragdoll animation system** inspired by Gang Beasts, Party Animals, and Fall Guys. This system completely replaces the previous keyframe-based animations with real-time physics simulation, providing natural, emergent character movement that responds dynamically to forces and impacts.

## Key Improvements

### Before (Keyframe-Based System)
- **Issues**: Pre-defined animation keyframes with interpolation
- **Problems**: 
  - Not physics-driven, animations were scripted
  - Limited interaction with physics forces
  - Characters couldn't naturally respond to impacts
  - Not authentic to Gang Beasts/Party Animals style
  - Difficult to make realistic ragdoll effects

### After (Physics-Based Ragdoll System)
- **Solution**: Full articulated ragdoll with physics constraints
- **Benefits**:
  - Authentic Gang Beasts/Party Animals gameplay
  - Natural, emergent animations from physics
  - Real-time response to all forces and impacts
  - True ragdoll effect on knockout
  - Wobbly, flexible character movement
  - Mixamo-compatible skeleton structure

## Character Structure

### Mixamo-Compatible Skeleton

The character uses a standard humanoid skeleton with 17 physics bodies:

**Torso/Spine:**
- `hips` - Root body, main control point (3 kg)
- `spine` - Mid torso (2.5 kg)
- `chest` - Upper torso (2.5 kg)

**Head/Neck:**
- `neck` - Connects head to chest (0.5 kg)
- `head` - Large head for comedic effect (1.5 kg)

**Left Arm:**
- `leftUpperArm` - Shoulder to elbow (0.8 kg)
- `leftForearm` - Elbow to wrist (0.6 kg)
- `leftHand` - Hand (0.3 kg)

**Right Arm:**
- `rightUpperArm` - Shoulder to elbow (0.8 kg)
- `rightForearm` - Elbow to wrist (0.6 kg)
- `rightHand` - Hand (0.3 kg)

**Left Leg:**
- `leftUpperLeg` - Hip to knee (1.2 kg)
- `leftLowerLeg` - Knee to ankle (0.9 kg)
- `leftFoot` - Foot (0.5 kg)

**Right Leg:**
- `rightUpperLeg` - Hip to knee (1.2 kg)
- `rightLowerLeg` - Knee to ankle (0.9 kg)
- `rightFoot` - Foot (0.5 kg)

**Total Mass:** ~17 kg per character

## Physics Constraints

### Joint Types

**Ball-and-Socket Joints** (Point-to-Point Constraints):
- Spine connections (hips ↔ spine ↔ chest ↔ neck ↔ head)
- Shoulders (chest ↔ upper arms)
- Wrists (forearms ↔ hands)
- Hips (hips ↔ upper legs)
- Ankles (lower legs ↔ feet)

**Hinge Joints** (Hinge Constraints):
- Elbows (upper arms ↔ forearms)
- Knees (upper legs ↔ lower legs)

### Constraint Properties
- `collideConnected: false` - Prevents connected bodies from colliding
- High angular damping (0.7) for stability
- Linear damping (0.4) for realistic movement
- Friction (0.8) for good ground contact
- Low restitution (0.1) for minimal bounce

## Motor System

### Balance Controller

The balance system keeps characters upright using active motors:

```javascript
applyBalanceForce() {
    // Upward force based on height deficit
    const upForce = (targetHeight - currentHeight) * 400 * speed;
    
    // Angular velocity damping
    hips.angularVelocity *= 0.6;
    
    // Quaternion blending toward upright
    const blendFactor = 0.05;
    hips.quaternion = lerp(hips.quaternion, uprightQuaternion, blendFactor);
}
```

### Limb Motors

Active pose maintenance for natural standing:

- **Leg Straightening:** Applies upward force to upper legs
- **Knee Control:** Prevents backward bending
- **Arm Damping:** Reduces flailing
- **Foot Grounding:** Downward bias to keep feet planted

## Animation States

### Standing (Active Motors)
- Balance controller keeps torso upright
- Limb motors maintain standing pose
- Responds to external forces
- Natural wobble from physics simulation

### Moving (Force-Based)
- Horizontal forces applied to hips and chest
- No foot placement animation - pure physics
- Natural weight shifting from physics
- Stumbling and recovery handled by motors

### Attacking (Force Application)
- **Punch:** 500N force applied to hand body
- **Dropkick:** 600N force to feet, 300N upward to hips
- Limb movement purely from applied forces
- Natural follow-through from physics

### Knockout (Full Ragdoll)
- All motor forces disabled
- Pure physics simulation
- Limbs respond naturally to gravity and impacts
- Realistic falling and tumbling

### Grabbed (Constrained Ragdoll)
- Motors disabled, physics only
- Body follows grabber with damping
- Can wake up and break free

## Technical Implementation

### Physics Loop (60 FPS)

```javascript
update() {
    // 1. Sync visual meshes with physics bodies
    for (body of physicsBodies) {
        mesh.position = body.position;
        mesh.quaternion = body.quaternion;
    }
    
    // 2. Apply motor forces (if not knocked out)
    if (!isKnockedOut) {
        applyBalanceForce();
        applyLimbMotors();
    }
    
    // 3. AI applies movement/attack forces
    if (aiState === 'seeking') {
        applyForce(direction * 150, hips);
        applyForce(direction * 100, chest);
    }
}
```

### Movement System

No walking animations - movement is entirely force-based:

```javascript
executeSeek() {
    const direction = normalize(target.position - character.position);
    const moveForce = 150 * speed;
    
    hips.applyForce(direction * moveForce);
    chest.applyForce(direction * moveForce * 0.67);
}
```

### Combat System

Attacks apply forces to specific limbs:

```javascript
punch() {
    const hand = bodies.rightHand;
    const direction = forward(hips.quaternion);
    const punchForce = 500 * strength;
    
    hand.applyForce(direction * punchForce);
    checkHit(hand.position, range, damage);
}

dropkick() {
    hips.applyForce(Vector3(0, 300, 0)); // Jump
    
    const kickForce = 600 * strength;
    leftFoot.applyForce(forward * kickForce);
    rightFoot.applyForce(forward * kickForce);
}
```

## Physics Parameters

## Best Practices

1. **Balance Tuning:** Adjust motor forces to achieve desired wobbliness
2. **Mass Distribution:** Realistic mass ratios between body parts
3. **Constraint Stiffness:** Not too stiff (mechanical) or loose (floppy)
4. **Damping Values:** Critical for stability vs. responsiveness
5. **Force Application:** Apply forces at appropriate points on bodies

## Conclusion

The physics-based ragdoll animation system provides authentic Gang Beasts/Party Animals gameplay with:
- Natural, emergent character movement
- Real-time physics response to all forces
- True ragdoll knockout effects
- Mixamo-compatible skeleton structure
- No keyframes needed - 100% physics-driven

This system is production-ready and provides the foundation for expanding with more sophisticated motor control, actual Mixamo model loading, and advanced animation blending.
