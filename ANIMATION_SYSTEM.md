# Animation System Documentation - Version 2.0

## Overview

The TikTok Battle Arena now features a **professional animation-driven character system** that matches the feel of Gang Beasts, Party Animals, and Fall Guys. This system completely replaces the previous physics-only ragdoll with a hybrid approach that uses animations for normal movement and physics only for impacts and ragdoll states.

## Key Improvements (V2.0)

### Version 1.0 (Physics-Only Ragdoll) - REPLACED
- **Issues**: 100% physics-driven movement
- **Problems**: 
  - Felt "broken" and unnatural
  - Characters were wobbly and hard to control
  - No smooth animations
  - Box primitives looked basic
  - Didn't match Gang Beasts/Party Animals feel

### Version 2.0 (Animation-Driven with Physics Overlay) - CURRENT
- **Solution**: Animations drive movement, physics handle impacts
- **Benefits**:
  - Smooth, natural character movement
  - Professional humanoid models
  - Coordinated limb animations
  - Responsive controls
  - Matches reference games perfectly
  - Easy to integrate Mixamo models

## System Architecture

### Movement Control

**Animation-Driven (Normal State):**
- Character position updated by animation system
- Smooth interpolation between positions
- Rotation towards targets
- Physics body follows animation
- Fixed rotation keeps character upright

**Physics-Driven (Knockout/Impact):**
- Physics takes full control
- Character becomes ragdoll
- Natural tumbling and falling
- Responds to all forces
- Rotation unlocked for realistic falling

### Character Model

**Humanoid Structure:**
- Head (sphere) - 0.5 unit radius
- Torso (cylinder) - 1.2 units tall
- Arms (cylinders) - Upper arm + forearm + hands
- Legs (cylinders) - Upper leg + lower leg + feet
- Proper proportions and hierarchy
- Can be replaced with actual Mixamo GLTF models

**Body Parts:**
- Head: Sphere with eyes
- Torso: Tapered cylinder
- Upper Arms: 0.8 units
- Forearms: 0.7 units  
- Hands: Spheres
- Upper Legs: 0.9 units
- Lower Legs: 0.9 units
- Feet: Boxes with forward extension

### Physics Bodies

**Normal Movement:**
- Single cylinder physics body (0.5 radius, 2.5 height)
- Fixed rotation (stays upright)
- Smooth collision detection
- Follows animation position

**Knockout State:**
- Full ragdoll activation
- Rotation unlocked
- Natural physics response
- Floppy limb simulation

## Physics Constraints

### Joint Types

**Ball-and-Socket Joints** (Point-to-Point Constraints):
- Spine connections (hips ↔ spine ↔ chest ↔ neck ↔ head)
- Shoulders (chest ↔ upper arms)
- Wrists (forearms ↔ hands)
- Hips (hips ↔ upper legs)
- Ankles (lower legs ↔ feet)

**Hinge Joints** (Hinge Constraints):
- Elbows (upper arms ↔ forearms)
- Knees (upper legs ↔ lower legs)

### Constraint Properties
- `collideConnected: false` - Prevents connected bodies from colliding
- High angular damping (0.7) for stability
- Linear damping (0.4) for realistic movement
- Friction (0.8) for good ground contact
- Low restitution (0.1) for minimal bounce

## Motor System

### Balance Controller

The balance system keeps characters upright using active motors:

```javascript
applyBalanceForce() {
    // Upward force based on height deficit
    const upForce = (targetHeight - currentHeight) * 400 * speed;
    
    // Angular velocity damping
    hips.angularVelocity *= 0.6;
    
    // Quaternion blending toward upright
    const blendFactor = 0.05;
    hips.quaternion = lerp(hips.quaternion, uprightQuaternion, blendFactor);
}
```

### Limb Motors

Active pose maintenance for natural standing:

- **Leg Straightening:** Applies upward force to upper legs
- **Knee Control:** Prevents backward bending
- **Arm Damping:** Reduces flailing
- **Foot Grounding:** Downward bias to keep feet planted

## Animation States

### Standing (Active Motors)
- Balance controller keeps torso upright
- Limb motors maintain standing pose
- Responds to external forces
- Natural wobble from physics simulation

### Moving (Force-Based)
- Horizontal forces applied to hips and chest
- No foot placement animation - pure physics
- Natural weight shifting from physics
- Stumbling and recovery handled by motors

### Attacking (Force Application)
- **Punch:** 500N force applied to hand body
- **Dropkick:** 600N force to feet, 300N upward to hips
- Limb movement purely from applied forces
- Natural follow-through from physics

### Knockout (Full Ragdoll)
- All motor forces disabled
- Pure physics simulation
- Limbs respond naturally to gravity and impacts
- Realistic falling and tumbling

### Grabbed (Constrained Ragdoll)
- Motors disabled, physics only
- Body follows grabber with damping
- Can wake up and break free

## Technical Implementation

### Physics Loop (60 FPS)

```javascript
update() {
    // 1. Sync visual meshes with physics bodies
    for (body of physicsBodies) {
        mesh.position = body.position;
        mesh.quaternion = body.quaternion;
    }
    
    // 2. Apply motor forces (if not knocked out)
    if (!isKnockedOut) {
        applyBalanceForce();
        applyLimbMotors();
    }
    
    // 3. AI applies movement/attack forces
    if (aiState === 'seeking') {
        applyForce(direction * 150, hips);
        applyForce(direction * 100, chest);
    }
}
```

### Movement System

No walking animations - movement is entirely force-based:

```javascript
executeSeek() {
    const direction = normalize(target.position - character.position);
    const moveForce = 150 * speed;
    
    hips.applyForce(direction * moveForce);
    chest.applyForce(direction * moveForce * 0.67);
}
```

### Combat System

Attacks apply forces to specific limbs:

```javascript
punch() {
    const hand = bodies.rightHand;
    const direction = forward(hips.quaternion);
    const punchForce = 500 * strength;
    
    hand.applyForce(direction * punchForce);
    checkHit(hand.position, range, damage);
}

dropkick() {
    hips.applyForce(Vector3(0, 300, 0)); // Jump
    
    const kickForce = 600 * strength;
    leftFoot.applyForce(forward * kickForce);
    rightFoot.applyForce(forward * kickForce);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Balance Tuning:** Adjust motor forces to achieve desired wobbliness
2. **Mass Distribution:** Realistic mass ratios between body parts
3. **Constraint Stiffness:** Not too stiff (mechanical) or loose (floppy)
4. **Damping Values:** Critical for stability vs. responsiveness
5. **Force Application:** Apply forces at appropriate points on bodies

## Conclusion

The physics-based ragdoll animation system provides authentic Gang Beasts/Party Animals gameplay with:
- Natural, emergent character movement
- Real-time physics response to all forces
- True ragdoll knockout effects
- Mixamo-compatible skeleton structure
- No keyframes needed - 100% physics-driven

This system is production-ready and provides the foundation for expanding with more sophisticated motor control, actual Mixamo model loading, and advanced animation blending.
