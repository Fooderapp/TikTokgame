# TikTok Battle Arena - Feature Documentation

## Game Overview
A 3D physics-based fighting game inspired by Party Animals and Gang Beasts, featuring AI-controlled characters, ragdoll physics, and team-based combat with TikTok gift integration.

## Core Gameplay Features

### 1. Physics-Based Combat System
**Inspired by Party Animals**
- **Ragdoll Physics**: Characters have realistic physics-based movement and collisions
- **Momentum-Based Attacks**: Punches and kicks transfer momentum to opponents
- **Tumbling & Falling**: Characters realistically tumble and fall from impacts
- **Platform Arena**: Central 30x30 unit platform with fall-off mechanics

### 2. AI Character Behavior
**Three Main States:**

#### Seeking State
- Scans for nearest enemy character
- Moves towards enemy using force-based locomotion
- Switches to attack when within 3 units
- Also looks for knocked-out enemies to grab

#### Attacking State
- Performs punch attacks (60% chance) or dropkicks (40% chance)
- Maintains optimal attack distance (2.5 units)
- Cooldown system prevents spam (1-2 seconds between attacks)
- Returns to seeking if enemy moves too far

#### Grabbing State
- Grabs knocked-out enemies automatically
- Carries them towards platform edge
- Throws them off when reaching edge (13+ units from center)
- Releases if enemy wakes up

### 3. Combat Mechanics

#### Punch Attack
- **Damage**: 20 HP
- **Force**: 200 units * strength multiplier
- **Range**: 2.5 units
- **Visual**: Arm swing animation
- **Cooldown**: 1-2 seconds

#### Dropkick Attack
- **Damage**: 35 HP
- **Self-Jump**: 8 units upward velocity
- **Forward Force**: 150 units
- **Target Force**: 300 units * strength multiplier
- **Range**: 3 units (effective hit range)
- **Visual**: Extended legs animation
- **Cooldown**: 1-2 seconds

### 4. Knockout System

#### Knockout Trigger
- Occurs when character health reaches 0
- Initial health: 100 HP
- Character becomes vulnerable and physics-only

#### Knockout Duration
- Base duration: 3-5 seconds (180-300 frames at 60 FPS)
- Visual feedback: Semi-transparent appearance (70% opacity)
- Character cannot perform actions while knocked out

#### Wake-Up Mechanic
- **Natural Recovery**: After knockout timer expires
- **Accelerated Recovery**: When grabbed (2x wake-up speed)
- **Escape Ability**: Upon waking, can break free from grab
- **Health Restoration**: Recovers to 50 HP when waking

### 5. Grab & Throw System
**Party Animals-Inspired Mechanic**

#### Grabbing
- AI automatically grabs knocked-out enemies within 3 units
- Grabbed character follows grabber with offset positioning
- Grabbed character's velocity is dampened
- Only one character can be grabbed at a time

#### Carrying
- Grabber AI moves towards platform edge
- Target: Corner of platform (¬±15 units from center)
- Grabbed character maintained at 1.5 units behind grabber

#### Throwing
- Triggers when grabber reaches platform edge (>13 units from center)
- Throw force: 400 units in outward and downward direction
- High chance of elimination if character stays knocked out

#### Breaking Free
- Character can wake up while being grabbed
- Wake-up progress: +0.5 per frame when grabbed (vs normal recovery)
- Upon waking: Apply escape force (¬±200 horizontal, +150 vertical)
- Automatically releases from grab

### 6. Team-Based Gameplay

#### Team Assignment
- **Blue Team**: Spawns on left side (-10 X position)
- **Red Team**: Spawns on right side (+10 X position)
- Team color coding: Blue (#4A90E2) and Red (#E24A4A)

#### Round System
- Round starts when at least one character per team exists
- Round ends when one team is completely eliminated
- Elimination: All team members fallen off platform or eliminated
- Winning team scores 1 point
- Auto-reset: New round starts after 3 seconds

#### Scoring
- Persistent across rounds
- Displayed at top of screen
- No win condition limit (infinite rounds)

## Game Balance

### Tested Scenarios
‚úÖ 1v1 combat - Balanced, engaging
‚úÖ 2v2 combat - Chaotic, fun
‚úÖ Asymmetric (2v1) - Challenging but fair
‚úÖ Large battles (4v4+) - Very chaotic, entertaining
‚úÖ Power boost impact - Significant but not overpowered

### Balance Considerations
- Knockout duration allows for grab but not guaranteed elimination
- Wake-up mechanic prevents frustrating helplessness
- Dropkick risk/reward (self-launch can backfire)
- Platform size allows maneuvering but enables eliminations
- Spawn positions prevent immediate spawn-camping

## Controls Summary

### Camera
- **Drag/Touch**: Rotate camera
- **Scroll/Pinch**: Zoom in/out

### Game Actions
- **Spawn Blue**: Add blue team fighter
- **Spawn Red**: Add red team fighter  
- **Power Boost**: Give random character boost

### AI (Automatic)
- Movement towards enemies
- Attack selection (punch/dropkick)
- Grab knocked-out enemies
- Throw enemies off platform
- Wake up and escape

All combat and character actions are handled by AI - players only spawn characters and apply boosts!
