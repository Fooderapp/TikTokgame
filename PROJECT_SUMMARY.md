## 🎮 Core Features Implemented

### 1. Physics-Based Combat System
- Realistic ragdoll physics using Cannon.js
- Momentum-based attacks (punches and dropkicks)
- Platform arena with fall-off detection
- Strong gravity for dramatic physics (-30 m/s²)

### 2. AI System (3 States)
- **Seeking**: Finds and moves towards enemies
- **Attacking**: Performs punches (60%) or dropkicks (40%)
- **Grabbing**: Captures knocked-out enemies and throws them off

### 3. Combat Mechanics
- **Punch**: Quick melee attack (20 damage, 200 force)
- **Dropkick**: Powerful jump kick (35 damage, 300 force)
- **Knockout**: Character becomes vulnerable at 0 HP
- **Health**: 100 HP start, 50 HP on recovery

### 4. Grab & Throw System (Party Animals Inspired)
- Automatic grab of knocked-out enemies (3 unit range)
- Carry to platform edge
- Throw off platform (400 unit force)
- Can escape by waking up

### 5. Wake-Up Mechanic
- Natural recovery after 3-5 seconds
- Faster recovery when grabbed (2x speed)
- Break-free escape on wake-up
- Health restoration to 50 HP

### 6. Team-Based Gameplay
- Blue team (left spawn, blue color)
- Red team (right spawn, red color)
- Persistent scoring across rounds
- Auto-reset after team elimination

### 7. TikTok Gift Integration
- Spawn Blue Fighter button (🎁)
- Spawn Red Fighter button (🎁)
- Power Boost button (⚡) - 2x strength, 1.5x speed, +50 HP

### 8. Visual & UI Features
- Real-time score display
- Character counter per team
- Round status messages
- Camera controls (drag/zoom)
- Shadow mapping and lighting
- Procedural animations

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- [x] Grab/throw mechanics
- [x] Wake/escape system
- [x] Round management
- [x] Scoring system
- [x] Camera controls
- [x] Gift buttons

### Battle Scenarios ✅
- [x] 1v1 combat
- [x] 2v2 combat
- [x] Asymmetric battles
- [x] Large battles (4v4+)
- [x] Power boost effects

### Security ✅
- [x] CodeQL scan (0 vulnerabilities)
- [x] No XSS issues
- [x] No data collection
- [x] Safe external dependencies

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Game Loads**: Three.js scene initializes with Cannon.js physics
2. **Characters Spawn**: One blue and one red fighter spawn on opposite sides
3. **AI Activates**: Characters automatically seek enemies
4. **Combat Begins**: AI performs punches and dropkicks
5. **Knockout Occurs**: Character at 0 HP enters knockout state
6. **Grab & Throw**: AI grabs knocked-out enemies and carries to edge
7. **Elimination**: Thrown character falls off platform
8. **Round Ends**: When one team is eliminated
9. **Score Updates**: Winning team gains 1 point
10. **Round Resets**: New round starts after 3 seconds
11. **Repeat**: Infinite rounds with persistent scoring
